We  have  implemented  the  model  on  an NVIDIA  Jetson  TX1  board,  which  has  NVIDIAMaxwell  GPU  with  256  NVIDIA  CUDA  Cores, hosted  onan  Ubuntu  environment.  The  board  has  a  5  MP  fixed  focus MIPI  CSI  camera  through  which  the  frames  are  fetched using a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A57 MPCore Processor with 4 GB LPDDR4  Memory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"}
