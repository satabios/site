The core decision making in a self driving car relies heavily on the relative position of the vehicle with respect to its surroundings. We introduce two novel techniques, first an event based attention sampling technique that leverages on the bio-inspired event data to adaptively sample the frame-based data. Secondly, a two-stream architecture that that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy.</p>"}
