We  leverage  uponthe recent advances in deep convolutional networks based videoanalysis  and  adapt  such  frameworks  onto  the  neuromorphicdomain.  We  also  provide  the  community  with  a  new  datasetconsisting of five categories of human activities captured in realworld  without  any  simulations.
