* [N-HAR: A Neuromorphic Event-Based Human Activity Recognition System using Memory Surfaces](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8702581)

  *  We used eventmemory surfaces to make the sparse event data compatible withdeep  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs).  We  leverage  uponthe recent advances in deep convolutional networks based videoanalysis  and  adapt  such  frameworks  onto  the  neuromorphicdomain.  We  also  provide  the  community  with  a  new  datasetconsisting of five categories of human activities captured in realworld  without  any  simulations.  We  achieved  an  accuracy  of94.3%  using  event  memory  surfaces  on  our  activity  recognitiondataset.
