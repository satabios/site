* [Real-time Implementation of Proto-Object Based Visual Saliency Model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8702200)

   * Our  current  implementation  considers  the  dynamic  temporal  motion change  by  convoluting  along  time  efficiently  by  parallelly processing  them.  We  have  implemented  the  model  on  an NVIDIA  Jetson  TX1  board,  which  has  NVIDIAMaxwell  GPU  with  256  NVIDIA  CUDA  Cores, hosted  onan  Ubuntu  environment.  The  board  has  a  5  MP  fixed  focus MIPI  CSI  camera  through  which  the  frames  are  fetched using a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A57 MPCore Processor with 4 GB LPDDR4  Memory.
