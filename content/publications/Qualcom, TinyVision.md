[Real-Time Object Detection and Localization in Compressive Sensed Video on Embedded Hardware]()


- Object detection and localization can be possible directly in the Compressed Domain (easily upto 20x compression).
- Achieved SOTA 46.27% mAP(Mean Average Precision) on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with an inference time of 23ms.
- Deployed on a NVIDIA TX2 embedded board with 45.11% mAP with an inference time of 34ms.
