<a>A REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION IN COMPRESSIVE SENSED VIDEO</a>
<i>*ICIP 2021 Paper Link yet to be linked</i>
- Object detection and localization can be possible directly in the Compressed Domain (easily upto 20x compression). 
- Achieved <a>SOTA 46.27\% mAP</a>(Mean Average Precision) on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with an inference time of 23ms.
- Deployed on a NVIDIA TX2 embedded board with <a>45.11\% mAP</a> with an inference time of <a>34ms</a>.
