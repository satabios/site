inivation DAVIS
Neuromorphically inspired camera, that is based on combining an active continuous-time front-end logarithmic photoreceptor with a self-timed switched-capacitor differencing circuit, the sensor achieves an array mismatch of 2.1% in relative intensity event threshold and a pixel bandwidth of 3 kHz under 1 klux scene illumination. Dynamic range is > 120 dB and chip power consumption is 23 mW. Event latency shows weak light dependency with a minimum of 15 mus at > 1 klux pixel illumination. The sensor is built in a 0.35 mum 4M2P process. It has 40times40 mum 2 pixels with 9.4% fill factor.
