<i>*ICIP 2021 Paper Link yet to be linked</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Object detection and localization can be possible directly in the Compressed Domain (easily upto 20x compression).</li>
  <li>Achieved <a>SOTA 46.27\% mAP</a>(Mean Average Precision) on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with an inference time of 23ms.</li>
  <li>Deployed on a NVIDIA TX2 embedded board with <a>45.11\% mAP</a> with an inference time of <a>34ms</a>.</li>
</ul>
