<p><a href="">Real-Time Object Detection and Localization in Compressive Sensed Video on Embedded Hardware</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Object detection and localization can be possible directly in the Compressed Domain (easily upto 20x compression).</li>
  <li>Achieved SOTA 46.27% mAP(Mean Average Precision) on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with an inference time of 23ms.</li>
  <li>Deployed on a NVIDIA TX2 embedded board with 45.11% mAP with an inference time of 34ms.</li>
