<p>Neuro-electronic hybrid systems have been gaining interest of researchers as a possible architecture for computing. This aims to exploit the strengths of biological neuronal systems with their immense parallel processing and learning capabilities along with that of VLSI systems. Towards this end, we have set up a system which demonstrates the use of a live neuronal culture to solve a real world problem of classification of natural audio/visual signals.</p>
